# 💬 Smart Student Assistant Agent (Academic AI)

An AI-powered academic assistant designed to help students and researchers navigate the world of education more effectively. Built using IBM Watsonx.ai and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), this intelligent agent offers contextual summaries, citation help, academic Q&A, and research recommendations—all through a friendly conversational interface.



## 🧩 Problem Statement

Many students, especially in underserved or non-English-speaking regions, face challenges in understanding complex academic material, finding relevant research papers, or formatting citations correctly. This creates barriers in research, learning, and academic performance.



## 💡 Proposed Solution

An AI agent trained using IBM Watsonx.ai that delivers document-grounded academic help. With multilingual support and retrieval-augmented responses, it provides clear, concise, and context-aware academic guidance—without straying into non-academic topics.



## 🧠 Technologies Used

- IBM Watsonx.ai Studio  
- IBM Granite Foundation Model (LLM)  
- Watsonx Vector Index (for Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  
- NLP for natural language interaction  
- PDF research papers and academic materials  

## ☁️ IBM Cloud Services Used

- Watsonx.ai Studio  
- IBM Granite LLM  
- Watsonx Vector Index  
- IBM Cloud IAM  
- IBM Cloud Object Storage  
- IBM Cloud Lite Account



## 👥 End Users

- Undergraduate and graduate students  
- Academic researchers  
- Professors and educators  
- Thesis writers and journal authors  
- Non-English-speaking learners  
- Educational NGOs and support groups  



## 🌟 WOW Factors

- Academic-only domain: Filters out unrelated queries like banking, travel, or entertainment  
- Uses RAG to provide grounded responses from uploaded PDFs  
- Supports citation generation in APA/MLA/IEEE formats  
- Handles off-topic inputs with polite redirection  
- Built entirely on IBM Cloud with secure, privacy-focused design  
- Prepares students for academic success with accurate, AI-generated learning support  



## 🧪 Key Features

- Document-based summarization and Q&A  
- Natural Language Processing with IBM Granite  
- PDF upload and vector indexing  
- Personalized academic recommendations  
- Multilingual support (configurable)  
- Intelligent citation formatting  
- Academic scope enforcement with AI Guardrails  


## 🚀 How It Works

1. 📥 User uploads an academic paper (PDF)  
2. ❓ User asks a question (e.g., “Summarize the conclusion”)  
3. 🧠 IBM Granite LLM processes the query  
4. 🔍 Vector Index retrieves the most relevant content from the document  
5. 💬 Agent replies with a clear, grounded answer  



 📌 How to Run or Deploy

1. Log in to IBM Cloud Lite: [https://cloud.ibm.com](https://cloud.ibm.com)  
2. Launch Watsonx.ai Studio  
3. Create a new AI Agent project  
4. Upload academic documents to Watsonx Vector Index  
5. Configure agent instructions (limit scope to academic topics)  
6. Test with various academic prompts  
7. Deploy via embedded web UI, custom portal, or Streamlit frontend
